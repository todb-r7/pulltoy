Pulltoy
-------

First world problem: My open source project is so popular I can't keep
up with pull requests any more.

Pulltoy attempts to resolve that, or at least salve it.

This public repo documents a long and painful way to not deal with GitHub pull requests.
Once it starts getting respectable, I'll start talking about it.

The goal right now is to be able to come up with a way to prioritize pull requests, and
that means getting different views than what's available in the standard GitHub pull
request pages.

If it's not obvious, I have http://github.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework/pulls in mind.
